  title: `ELAN`,
  body: `ELAN (Esoteric Language Analysis Network) is a web platform for exploring and analyzing esoteric programming languages (esolangs). It provides a centralized hub for information, resources, and tools, leveraging a conceptual model (ontology/thesaurus) built from existing esolang lists like Wikidata.
  ELAN offers a SPARQL endpoint for querying the knowledge base, enabling detailed information retrieval about esolangs, their features, tools, and applications.  The platform also recommends esolangs based on user preferences, language categories, and pragmatic use cases.  ELAN aims to make esolangs more accessible for learning, programming, research, and general discovery.`,
